      <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Communications from Florida State. I wanted to write and create but
        also craved a fast-paced work environement. After writing for the FSView newspaper and interning
        at a PR firm I decided to use my skills in Public Relations. Life happened and I took a haitus
        from working to raise a family. After that time the public relations game had changed because of
        social media and it was obvious I would have to relearn the field. Inspired by my husband who is
        a Software Developer I decided to learn software instead.
        I taught myself QA. I took Udemy courses on software testing and took the ISTQB to be certified
        in software testing. I worked for almost 4 years testing software as a Quality Assurance
        Engineer. I found some interesting bugs and really enjoyed mobile and API testing. However, I
        found myself not really interested in just QA. I didn't want to just test software anymore. I
        want to make software, awesome software.</p>

      <p>I live in Kennesaw, GA with my husband Andy and our three children. I love sewing and have made
        some very cool costumes and some decent clothes. There is typically an unfinished jigsaw puzzle
        out in my house; I just finished my second 3000 piece puzzle! I love cats a lot, I am very
        thankful my husband stops me from becoming a crazy cat lady!</p>
